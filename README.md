# PCC_Exercises

  Keeping track of all my exercises done from the book "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes. 

  Im using all the programs Ive written to study all the concepts and problems covered in the book- to also learn how to use git and github. I only started tracking all my work once I got to page 125, thats why a lot of files were added in the initial commit. For every commit after the initial I will simply put the date the commit was made (e.g 'MM.DD.YYYY'), with a goal of making one everyday. I will only use the terminal to make all following changes to the repo ... Well, besides this one. 

  I tried to keep the exercises organised in some fasion, but things may be a bit haphazard for the most part. Some files with actual names may also contain parts from the chapters exercises. For files with numbers, the first number stands for the chapter, and then the following numbers describe which excercises from said chapters they contain:
  
  # '5-4-8' = Exercises 4 through 8, for chapter 5.
  
 You are free to use this code in anyway, thought Im not sure what for other than to cheat your way through this book, which, is just dumb. I will be making a seperate repo for the project portion of this book just to keep things a little more organised.
