# Part 1: Pizzas

# Making a list of my favorite pizzas
fpizza = ["Lamb Pizza", "Meat Lovers Pizza", "Stuffed Crust Pizza"]

# Making a loop exclaiming my love for each pizza
for pizza in fpizza:
	print("I love " + pizza + "!")

# Extra love for pizza
print("\nI could eat like 500 pieces of pizza at once.\n")
print("I really love pizza!\n")

# Part 2: Animals 

# Making a list of animals 
animals = ["duck", "platypus", "ostrich"]

# Making a loop describing them all
for animal in animals:
	print(animal.title() + "'s can lay eggs")

# Extra thoughts on the matter
print("\nI wonder if the eggs all taste the same ...")
